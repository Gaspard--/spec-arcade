Score format:

Ex:
---
GameName:
player points
player points
GameName2:
player points
---

The score file is seperated into section starting with the line "GAME:" without quotes.
The next lines contain each player name and a score seperated by whitespace.
If the format of the score file is invalid, the implementation is free to do what it wants.
